# Welcome!

This page mainly demonstrates work that have completed while completing my masters in Data Science from Bellevue University. I currently work at Graphic Packaging as a Supply Chain Optimization Analyst. Some projects completed in my course are related to work I have completed at Graphic Packaging. The data has been changed so no proprietary information is shared.

Below are links to my bio and project list. I also included sample visual from past projects and links directly to those projects.
